We use Evolution Gym (evogym) as the test suite to empirically validate the performance of AIEA. More infomation about evogym can refer to https://evolutiongym.github.io.

- The code of AIEA is placed in source code/examples/SAEA/AIEA.py. After installing evogym, run run_aiea.py to test the performance of AIEA.

- All the simulation animations are placed in the animation folder.
