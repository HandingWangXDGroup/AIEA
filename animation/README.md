# AIEA-GIF

The optimal robot designs obtained by genetic algorithm(GA), Bayesian optimization (BO), Random forest-assisted evolutionary algorithm (RFEA), and action inheritance-based evolutionary algorithm(AIEA) in five independent runs.

The simulation animation and rewards have been placed in markdown files.
